# Foundations-of-Computer-Science

This is the final project for the Foundations of Computer Science course, Data Science Master's Degree, University of Milano-Bicocca.

This work aims to do some analysis on the on the [ZTBus: A Large Dataset of Time-Resolved City Bus Driving Missions](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/626723) repository data.

It contains:
*  [metaData.csv](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/626723/metaData.csv?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), shortly *trips*
*  several other files containing detailed data on some bus parameters, whose name is in the *trips* file. Those files can be downloaded as a [zip file](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/626723/ZTBus_compressed.zip?sequence=3&isAllowed=y). Let us call those datasets the *details* datasets.
